<h2><font face="arial">Overview:</font></h2>

<p><font face="arial" size=-1>Diabetic retinopathy is retinopathy (damage to the retina) caused by complications of diabetes mellitus, which could eventually lead to blindness. It is an ocular manifestation of systemic disease which affects up to 80% of all diabetics who have had diabetes for 15 years or more[citation needed]. Despite these intimidating statistics, research indicates that at least 90% of these new cases could be reduced if there was proper and vigilant treatment and monitoring of the eyes.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial" size=-1>The Diabetic Retinopathy can evolve to blindness if it is severe or even affects the macula.</font></p>

<h2><font face="arial">Prevalence:</font></h2>
<font face="arial" size=-1>The duration of diabetes is probably the strongest predictor for development and progression of retinopathy. Among younger-onset patients with diabetes in the WESDR, the prevalence of any retinopathy was 8% at 3 years, 25% at 5 years, 60% at 10 years, and 80% at 15 years. The prevalence of PDR was 0% at 3 years and increased to 25% at 15 years. The incidence of retinopathy also increased with increasing duration. The 4-year incidence of developing proliferative retinopathy in the WESDR younger-onset group increased from 0% during the first 5 years to 27.9% during years 13–14 of diabetes. After 15 years, the incidence of developing PDR remained stable.</font></p>

<h2><font face="arial">Prevention/Treatment:</font></h2>
<font face="arial" size=-1>There are three major treatments for diabetic retinopathy, which are very effective in reducing vision loss from this disease. In fact, even people with advanced retinopathy have a 90 percent chance of keeping their vision when they get treatment before the retina is severely damaged. Still, the best way of addressing diabetic retinopathy is to monitor it vigilantly and ensure that it does not happen in the first place by careful blood glucose control and limitation of dietary fructose.</font></p>

<font face="arial" size=-1>These three treatments are laser surgery, injection of triamcinolone into the eye and vitrectomy. It is important to note that although these treatments are very successful, they do not cure diabetic retinopathy. Caution should be exercised in treatment with laser surgery since it causes a loss of retinal tissue. It is often more prudent to inject triamcinolone. In some patients it results in a marked increase of vision, especially if there is an edema of the macula.</font></p>

<font face="arial" size=-1>Avoiding tobacco use and correction of associated hypertension are important therapeutic measures in the management of diabetic retinopathy.</font></p>
