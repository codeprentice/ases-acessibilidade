<h2><font face="arial">Overview:</font></h2>

<font face="arial" size=-1>A cataract is an opacity that develops in the crystalline lens of the eye or in its envelope. Early on in the development of age-related cataract the power of the crystalline lens may be increased, causing near-sightedness (myopia), and the gradual yellowing and opacification of the lens may reduce the perception of blue colours. Cataracts typically progress slowly to cause vision loss and are potentially blinding if untreated.[1] Moreover, with time the cataract cortex liquefies to form a milky white fluid in a Morgagnian Cataract, and can cause severe inflammation if the lens capsule ruptures and leaks. Untreated, the cataract can cause phacomorphic glaucoma. Very advanced cataracts with weak zonules are liable to dislocation anteriorly or posteriorly. Such spontaneous posterior dislocations (akin to the historical surgical procedure of couching) in ancient times were regarded as a blessing from the heavens, because it restored some perception of light in the bilaterally affected patients.</font>

<h2><font face="arial">Prevalence:</font></h2>
<font face="arial" size=-1>5,500,000 people have a cataract interfering with their vision in the USA. Approx 1 in 49 or 2.02% or 5.5 million people in USA have cataracts.</font>

<h2><font face="arial">Prevention/Treatment:</font></h2>
<font face="arial" size=-1>Since smoking contributes to the risk of developing cataracts, smoking cessation is a vital step in cataract prevention.

<p><font face="arial" size=-1>Wearing sunglasses that block ultraviolet light and a hat with a wide brim will help reduce eye exposure to UV radiation and may cut the risk of cataracts. Virtually all sunglasses with tinted plastic lenses provide protection against UV radiation; there is no relationship between the cost of a pair of sunglasses and its UV-blocking ability.</font></p>

<p><font face="arial" size=-1>Whether certain medications can reduce the risk of cataracts is controversial. The results of trials of medications, such as aspirin or hormone replacement therapy, have been contradictory. Some researchers have proposed that antioxidant vitamins from foods or vitamin supplements might help prevent cataracts by protecting against free radicals--unstable oxygen molecules that over time can damage various components of the lens. Population studies have found a link between high intakes of antioxidants and a reduced incidence of cataracts, but results from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study, a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, found no such benefit from antioxidant supplements.

<p><font face="arial" size=-1>Surgery: cataract surgery is the removal of the lens of the eye (also called "crystalline") that has developed an opacification, which is referred to as a cataract.</font></p>
