<h2><font face="arial">Overview:</font></h2>

<p><font face="arial" size=-1>Glaucoma is a group of diseases of the optic nerve involving loss of retinal ganglion cells in a characteristic pattern of optic neuropathy. Although raised intraocular pressure is a significant risk factor for developing glaucoma, there is no set threshold for intraocular pressure that causes glaucoma. One person may develop nerve damage at a relatively low pressure, while another person may have high eye pressure for years and yet never develop damage. Untreated glaucoma leads to permanent damage of the optic nerve and resultant visual field loss, which can progress to blindness.</font></p>

<h2><font face="arial">Types:</font></h2>

	<p><font face="arial" size=-1>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Primary Open Angle Glaucoma:</b> This is the most common form of glaucoma, affecting about three million Americans. It happens when the eye’s drainage canals become clogged over time. The inner eye pressure (also called intraocular pressure or IOP) rises because the correct amount of fluid can’t drain out of the eye. With open angle glaucoma, the entrances to the drainage canals are clear and should be working correctly. The clogging problem occurs further inside the drainage canals, similar to a clogged pipe below the drain in a sink.

Most people have no symptoms and no early warning signs. If open angle glaucoma is not diagnosed and treated, it can cause a gradual loss of vision. This type of glaucoma develops slowly and sometimes without noticeable sight loss for many years. It usually responds well to medication, especially if caught early and treated.</li>
		<li><b>Angle Closure Glaucoma:</b> This type of glaucoma is also known as acute glaucoma or narrow angle glaucoma. It is much more rare and is very different from open angle glaucoma in that the eye pressure usually rises very quickly.

This happens when the drainage canals get blocked or covered over, like a sink with something covering the drain.

With angle closure glaucoma, the iris is not as wide and open as it should be. The outer edge of the iris bunches up over the drainage canals, when the pupil enlarges too much or too quickly. This can happen when entering a dark room.

A simple test can be used to see if your angle is normal and wide or abnormal and narrow. Treatment of angle closure glaucoma usually involves surgery to remove a small portion of the outer edge of the iris. This helps unblock the drainage canals so that the extra fluid can drain. Usually surgery is successful and long lasting. However, you should still receive regular check-ups.

Symptoms of angle closure glaucoma may include headaches, eye pain, nausea, rainbows around lights at night, and very blurred vision.</li>
		<li><b>Normal Tension Glaucoma (NTG):</b> Normal tension glaucoma is also known as low-tension glaucoma or normal pressure glaucoma. In this type of glaucoma, the optic nerve is damaged even though intraocular pressure (IOP) is not very high. Doctors do not know why some people’s optic nerves suffer damage even though pressure levels are in the “normal” range (between 12-22 mm Hg).

Those at higher risk for this form of glaucoma are people with a family history of normal tension glaucoma, people of Japanese ancestry, and people with a history of systemic heart disease, such as irregular heart rhythm. Normal tension glaucoma is usually detected after an examination of the optic nerve.

The Glaucoma Research Foundation sponsored a collaborative international study to help determine the best treatment for this type of glaucoma. The study concluded that eye drops used to lower intraocular pressure were effective even in cases of normal tension glaucoma. Currently, most doctors treat normal tension glaucoma by keeping normal eye pressures as low as possible with medicines, laser surgery, or filtering surgery.</li>
		<li><b>Pediatric Glaucoma:</b> The pediatric glaucomas consist of congenital glaucoma (present at birth), infantile glaucoma (appears during the first three years), juvenile glaucoma (age three through the teenage or young adult years), and all the secondary glaucomas occurring in the pediatric age group.

Congenital glaucoma is present at birth and most cases are diagnosed during the first year of life. Sometimes symptoms are not recognized until later in infancy or early childhood.

The range of treatment is very different from that for adult glaucoma. It is very important to catch pediatric glaucoma early in order to prevent blindness.</li>
		<li><b>Secondary Glaucoma:</b> Glaucoma can occur as the result of an eye injury, inflammation, tumor or in advanced cases of cataract or diabetes. It can also be caused by certain drugs such as steroids. This form of glaucoma may be mild or severe. The type of treatment will depend on whether it is open angle or angle closure glaucoma.</li>

<h2><font face="arial">Prevalence:</font></h2>
<font face="arial" size=-1>2,000,000 people are visually impaired by glaucoma in the USA. Approx 1 in 136 or 0.74% or 2 million people in USA.</font>

<h2><font face="arial">Prevention/Treatment:</font></h2>
<font face="arial" size=-1>There are three primary mechanisms for lowering eye pressure: 

<ol>
	<li>Decrease the amount of aqueous humor coming into the eye i.e. reduce the production of aqueous,</li> 
	<li>Increase the amount of aqueous leaving the eye i.e. increase the outflow of aqueous. Some medications decrease the production of aqueous humor whereas others increase the outflow. Aqueous humor flows out of the eye using two pathways: one that is sensitive to eye pressure (the trabecular meshwork pathway) and one that operates independently of eye pressure (the uveoscleral pathway).
From all of the available choices, a reasonable initial approach would be to choose an eyedrop that will get the eye pressure as low as safely possible in each particular patient, and</li>
	<li>Surgery is the primary therapy for those with congenital glaucoma. Both laser and conventional surgeries are performed. Generally, these operations are a temporary solution, as there is no cure for glaucoma as of yet.</li></font>
